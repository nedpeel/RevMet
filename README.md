# RevMet

RevMet (Reverse Metagenomics) is a method that allows reliable and semi-quantitative characterization of the species composition of mixed-species eukaryote samples, such as bee-collected pollen, without requiring assembled reference genomes. Instead, reference species are represented only by ‘genome skims’: low-cost, low-coverage, short-read datasets. The skims are mapped to long reads sequenced from mixed-species samples, using nanopore sequencing, and the long reads are uniquely assigned to eukaryote species.

To learn more about RevMet and how to implement the method, see the [RevMet Documentation](https://revmet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

RevMet (Reverse Metagenomics) is a method for reliable and semi-quantitative characterization of the species composition of mixed-species eukaryote samples, such as bee-collected pollen, without requiring reference genomes. Instead, reference species are represented only by ‘genome skims’: low-cost, low-coverage, short-read datasets. The skims are mapped to individual long reads sequenced from mixed-species samples using the MinION, a portable nanopore DNA-sequencing device, and the long reads are uniquely assigned to eukaryote species.
